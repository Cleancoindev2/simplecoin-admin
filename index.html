<section id=explanation>
  <p>A simplecoin is one type of stablecoin which can be run by an individual or
  organization.

  <p>It uses a reduced Token collateral model controlled by an owner address. In
  the simplest case, stablecoin holders have no protections against the owner,
  but constraints can be encoded in the owner as a contract.

  <p> Some example failure modes: never refreshing the price (getting locked
  out of the contract, losing the key, etc.); setting a bad a price (or
  “insider trading”); withdrawing too much ETH.  There are many different
  ways to handle these failure modes, but this code must be decided on and
  written by each contract owner.

  <p>This simplecoin has three permissioned user classes: "admin", "issuer"
  and "holder". An <em>admin</em> can manage collateral types, including
  registration, debt celings and price feeds.  <em>Issuers</em> can exchange
  collateral for simplecoins and form the link with <em>holders</em>, who are
  able to use the simplecoin as an ERC20 token.  All questions of access and
  authentication are left up to the contract deployer, the "owner", who can
  configure this as they wish.

  <p>The code is as simple as possible to reduce the cost of independent
  verification. It is just a building block that needs to be carefully
  constrained. It is also completely unsuitable for maintaining price stability
  at scale, besides also being unsuitable for any purpose in general.

  <p> The idea is to give potential <a target=_blank

  href=https://github.com/makerdao/maker-market>market</a> <a target=_blank
  href=https://github.com/makerdao/maker-market-matcher>makers</a> something
  to do while Maker’s stablecoin engine undergoes refinement.
